upload-image allows you to upload image files to various image hostings like free image hosting imageshack.us directly from terminal.

Latest news [here](NEWS.md).

Just type in the terminal emulator something like:

```
upload-image -s imageshack.us google-logo.png
```

Program is still under developement but is already usable.

Here are some screenshots:

Currently (SVN-version) supports the following services:
  * imageshack.us
  * radikal.ru

picoodle.com is not supported anymore because it's blocked anonymous upload.

My current plans about `upload-image` you can find in [TODO](TODO.md) document.

Idea and some code of program was inspired by Photo Uploader software
